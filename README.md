# Adolescent Advice & Assistance (Mental Health Proposal)

A Loyola University Chicago Spring 2019 Independent Study (COMP 398) with Dr. Nicholas Hayward.

This project will be a website based on a fictional proposal on mental health that I wrote for my Scientific and Technical Communications course (COMP 250).

The company, occupation roles, and budget were fictional for the purpose of the assignment, however the qualifications are realistic.

## Purpose

I wrote about mental health for my proposal because it is something that more people need to be more aware of.

I want to create a website for it because it can further help raise awareness on mental health and what they can do to help people struggling with mental illnesses.

As a Software Engineering major with a minor in Psychology, I plan to combine my knowledge of computer science and psychology.
