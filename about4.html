    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <button class="question">Who is eligible for Mentors for Mental Health?</button>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        Only 20 low-income schools in your city or town are eligible. Our program
        is offered to low-income schools since they do not recieve enough funding
        to have many mental health resources for their students. Schools must
        apply and be approved before 50 or fewer school staff are able to receive
        our training.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="question">Why does it include non-teachers (security and
      uppclassmen)?</button>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        We train teachers because they are staff that interact with students the
        most. However, we train security because there are many cases where security
        guards mishandle or abuse students with mental illnesses. Security can avoid
        mishandling students if they are aware that they may have mental health
        issues. Upperclassmen, 10 juniors and 10 seniors, are allowed to receive
        training if they and their parents consent them to do so. It is important
        for students to have peers who understand mental illnesses.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="question">When will the training take place?</button>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        Training will take place over the summer during July. We chose the
        training to be set in July because it is near the time when some schools
        begin their school year. By July, some schools and teachers will have their
        curriculum prepared, so our training will not interfere with their planning.
        Since our training is closer to when a school year starts, staff and
        volunteering upperclassmen will be prepared to apply what they have
        learned.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="question">Who will conduct the lectures in the training?</button>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        The lectures will be conducted by psychology professionals, which may be
        psychologists, psychology professors, or psychiatrists. They will choose
        the material and organize the lectures.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="question">Is the program free?</button>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        Yes! We are a free program because we are aware that low-income schools
        do not receive enough funding to support their students.
