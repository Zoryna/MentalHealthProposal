      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            We aim to be a mental health support system for adolescents, because
            it is apparent that they lack resources for their mental health. We
            believe the best way to support adolescents is to provide services
            to the community they are a part of: school. Our program, Mentors
            for Mental Health, will train school staff to recognize and achnowledge
            students who may suffer from mental illnesses. It is important that
            students are in an environment where they know they are cared for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone can be affected by mental disorders, and we work to overall spread
          more awareness on mental health. Mentors for Mental Health educates
          school staff, but we provide educational information and advice to
          adolescents, and parents, on how to approach someone to discuss mental
          illnesses.
        </p>

      <h1>Our Values</h1>
        <p>
          People should not experience mental illnesses alone. We know that
          having more resources can overall increase the mental health of
          everyone. It is important for people to have accessible resources if
          they are unable afford professional help. Sometimes mental disorders
          can be recognized and treated sooner, and it can truly make a difference.
