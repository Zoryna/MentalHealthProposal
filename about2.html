      <h1>Mentors for Mental Health</h1>
        <p>
          Mentors for Mental Health is a one-week mental health training program.
          It trains high school staff and high school upperclassmen of participating
          schools to detect mental illnesses in students and possibly help them
          find some professional help. Our program will educate all participants,
          but it will focus on teachers, student peers, and security guards.
          It will offer informational courses on abnormal psychology, social
          psychology, and the specific challenges that students with low
          socioeconomic status face. It will also train them on how to approach
          students and offer support if they seem to be showing some symptoms
          of a mental illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one-week program will be available to 20 low-income schools where
          50 staff members and 10 high school juniors and 10 high school seniors
          per participating school can be a part of the program. Upperclassmen must
          apply to participate and must receive parent permission, as they will
          receive training from outside of their school. They will be chosen based
          on leadership qualities, passion to help others, recommendations, and
          good academic standing. Mentors for Mental health is divided into two
          parts: lecture and training.
        </p>
        <p>
          School staff and upperclassmen will be divided into groups to do
          activities. The activities will consist of analyzing face expressions
          and body language, quizzing each other on mental illnesses and symptoms,
          and role playing activities where participants pretend to be in a
          realistic situation.They will also receive informational manuals and
          pamphlets to use as reference once the training program is over. The
          material ranges from directions on who to contact if a student needs
          professional help to instructions on comforting someone from a panic
          attack. Mentors for Mental Health will prepare participants for
          unexpected situations.
