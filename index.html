      <h1>Adolescent Advice & Assistance</h1>
        <p>
          Adolescent Advice & Assistance is an organization that promotes mental
          wellness by providing services to help bring mental health awareness
          and to assist youth with mental illnesses. We want to normalize
          discussions on mental health and how to provide support for those who
          suffer from mental disorders. We are a support system for adolescents
          in high school.
        </p>

        <p>
          We focus on mental illness in adolescents, or high school students,
          because people need a strong support system around that age. High
          school staff interact with students for a majority of their day in
          many days of the week, and it is important for staff to recognize if
          a student is struggling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our organization created a program, Mentors for Mental Health, where
          school staff is trained to recognize and acknowledge students who
          may suffer from a mental illness. Our program teaches school staff
          how to recognize symptoms of mental illnesses and how to properly
          assist them.
