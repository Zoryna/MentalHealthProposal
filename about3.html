      <h1>Outcome</h1>
        <p>
          If Mentors for Mental Health is implemented in schools, the mental
          health of students will improve, and it will create a healthy, supportive
          environment within education. School staff will have better relationships
          with the students, and students will feel like they are in a community
          that understands and validates them. The stigma surrounding mental health
          will diminish, people will be more open about their mental health, and
          others will be more understanding and caring toward people who are
          struggling.
